# pyenv
#   For a library that is installed into a virtualenv, it is reasonable to ignore these files.
#   For a library that is installed system-wide, it is less reasonable, but please do not commit
#   .python-version files into the repository unless you know what you're doing. See pyenv-win
#   (https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) for further information.

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow
